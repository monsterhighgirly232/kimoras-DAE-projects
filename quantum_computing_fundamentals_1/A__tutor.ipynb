    "\n",
    "## What is Quantum Interference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my own words:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Quantum interference is when the waves cancel each other out due to adding waves or through the z gate]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Z Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does the Z gate do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Z Gate is when the 0 stays a 0 and the 1 changes to a -1 but the negative doesnt mean the number itself is changing it only flips creating a wave] \n",

    "**Draw or describe the effect:**\n",

    "|0⟩ → _0______________\n",

    "## The H-Z-H Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: First H gate does...**\n",
    "\n",
    "[The first H gate put it into superposition and basically saying that the result can either be 0 or 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Z gate does...**\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Z gate flips the number one and turned it into -1 so you can tell if the outcome is balanced or all the same outcome]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Second H gate does...**\n",
    "\n",
    "[The second H gate figures out if the results cancel each other out or not]\n",
    "\n",
    "**The result is:**\n",

    "[Your explanation]\n",
    "\n",
    "--- basically its giving you a final answer or solution to the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "this matters because youll get your solution and youll know the process and how quantum came up with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is interference used in quantum algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "[interference is basically the way to make certain parts stand out like how the Z gate flipes the ones.]\n",
