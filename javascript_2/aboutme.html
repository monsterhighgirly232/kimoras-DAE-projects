    <p> Hiii my name is Kimora Dash and im 16 years old.I made this website because ever since i was young I liked to watch monster high and I was fasinated by the unique fashion styles that I saw. Another reason I wanted to make this website is because, I wanted there to be an easier way to find clothing that I liked,purchasing them all in the same place, and have a way of seeing how they would look on me instead of waiting till the shirt,pants,ect got here to find out it was too big or little.
